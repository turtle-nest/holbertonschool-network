# ✍️ Blog Post: *What Happens When You Type [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com) in Your Browser and Press Enter?*

### Introduction

Every time you browse the web, a series of complex systems work together seamlessly in the background to bring content to your screen. But what actually happens behind the scenes when you type `https://www.google.com` into your browser and press Enter?

This article breaks down the entire process—from DNS to database—covering the layers that make the web work.

### 1. DNS Resolution: Finding Google's IP Address

The first step is translating the human-readable URL (`www.google.com`) into a machine-readable IP address.

* The browser checks its **DNS cache**.
* If not found, it queries the **Operating System's resolver**.
* The resolver may contact:

  * **Local DNS server** (often provided by your ISP)
  * **Recursive DNS servers** (which may query Root, TLD, and Authoritative name servers)
* Eventually, it retrieves the **A record** for `www.google.com`, giving the IP address (e.g. `142.250.190.132`).

This is the **Domain Name System (DNS)** in action.

---

### 2. TCP/IP: Establishing a Connection

Once the IP is known, the browser initiates a **TCP connection** using the **Transport Control Protocol** over the **IP protocol**.

* TCP performs a **three-way handshake**:

  1. SYN: The client initiates the connection.
  2. SYN-ACK: The server acknowledges.
  3. ACK: The client confirms.

TCP ensures **reliable, ordered** data transfer.

### 3. Firewall: Controlling Access

Before the request reaches Google’s servers, it may pass through:

* **Local firewall** (on your device)
* **ISP firewall**
* **Corporate/enterprise firewalls**
* **Google’s perimeter firewalls**

Firewalls inspect and filter traffic based on rules to block malicious or unauthorized requests.

---

### 4. HTTPS & SSL/TLS: Securing the Communication

Because the URL starts with `https`, an **SSL/TLS handshake** occurs:

* The browser requests the server’s **SSL certificate**.
* It checks that the certificate:

  * Is signed by a trusted **Certificate Authority (CA)**
  * Matches the domain
* They agree on an **encryption algorithm** and **generate session keys**.
* The rest of the communication is **encrypted**, ensuring privacy and data integrity.

---

### 5. Load Balancer: Distributing Traffic

Your request then hits Google’s **load balancer**, a component that:

* **Distributes traffic** across multiple servers
* Improves **performance**, **scalability**, and **redundancy**
* May use algorithms like **Round Robin**, **Least Connections**, or **Geo-based routing**

This ensures your request goes to a server with the lowest latency or optimal health.

---

### 6. Web Server: Handling the HTTP Request

The request reaches a **web server** (e.g. Google’s custom infrastructure or Nginx/Apache in other stacks).

* It **parses the URL**, **headers**, and **cookies**
* It routes the request to the appropriate **application logic**

For static content (images, JS, HTML), the web server may respond directly. For dynamic content, it passes the request to the application layer.

---

### 7. Application Server: Generating Dynamic Content

The **application server** runs Google’s backend code (written in C++, Java, Go, or Python).

* It handles business logic
* It may perform:

  * User authentication
  * Query parsing
  * Service orchestration (e.g. search results)

The application server prepares a response, often needing to interact with a database.

---

### 8. Database: Storing and Fetching Data

Finally, the application may query a **database system** (e.g. Bigtable, Spanner, or MySQL-like engines).

* The query retrieves relevant data:

  * Search indexes
  * User preferences
  * Language or location settings
* The data is returned to the application, which formats the result (e.g., search page) into an HTTP response.

---

### Final Response: Back to the Browser

* The response flows back over the same **TCP connection**.
* The browser receives the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
* The **rendering engine** builds the **DOM**, paints the pixels, and executes scripts.
* Google’s homepage appears—almost instantly.

---

### Conclusion

From typing a URL to seeing the rendered page, dozens of components work together: DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, encryption, load balancers, web servers, application logic, and databases.

Understanding this flow not only improves your debugging skills but also prepares you for any backend, frontend, or DevOps role.
